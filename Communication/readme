brain dump of how this is going to work


Comms.cpp should encapsulate the communication medium. Classes write to the
Comms class message queue and the Comms class decides how to transmit the data
(does it go over radio or the network?)

probably get some private constructor idioms going in here to make sure we bootstrap
everything correctly.
